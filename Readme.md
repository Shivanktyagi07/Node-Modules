## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to build server-side applications using JavaScript. One of the core features of Node.js is its modular system, which enables you to organize your code into reusable components called modules. This repository explores various types of modules and how to work with them.

## Types of Modules

### Core Modules

Node.js comes with a set of built-in core modules that you can use without installing any additional packages. These modules provide essential functionality, such as file system operations, HTTP server creation, and more.

### Local Modules

Local modules are custom modules that you create for your specific project. You can structure your codebase into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain.

### Third-party Modules

Node Package Manager (NPM) provides access to a vast ecosystem of third-party modules created by the community. These modules extend the functionality of Node.js and allow you to integrate additional features and libraries into your applications.

### ES6 Modules

With the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) modules in Node.js, you can use the `import` and `export` syntax to organize your code even more cleanly and take advantage of modern JavaScript features.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
